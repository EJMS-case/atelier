## [Unreleased] — F1 Closet auto-detection — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **AI auto-detect on upload** — every new photo runs through `claude-haiku-4-5` and auto-fills category, subcategory, primary + secondary color (with hex), brand (when a logo is visible), material, pattern, and up to four styling tags. User edits made during detection are never overwritten.
- **Layered background removal** — new `src/lib/bgRemoval.js` pipeline: Remove.bg → `@imgly/background-removal` (free, in-browser WASM, lazy-loaded) → keep-original + `has_bg: true` flag. A small BG badge appears in the upload queue when the original background is still present, flagging items for later cleanup.
- **New wardrobe fields** — migration `supabase/migrations/0001_closet_autodetect.sql` adds `primary_color_hex`, `secondary_color`, `secondary_color_hex`, `material`, `pattern`, `tags[]`, `wear_count`, `thumbnail_url`, `has_bg`, `detected_at`, `detection_confidence`. Indexes on `last_worn` and `created_at` for downstream features.
- **Edit form fields** — all new detection fields editable inline on the Edit Item screen, including a color-swatch preview next to the hex input and a pattern select.
- New module `src/lib/anthropic.js` as the single entry point for Anthropic API calls going forward.
- `src/features/closet/applyDetection.js` — merges AI results into a queued upload only when the user hasn't manually set that field.

### Changed
- `BulkAddView` now runs BG strip + AI detect in parallel on every upload; the status overlay shows a single spinner until both finish.

### Safety
- Migration is additive-only (`add column if not exists`) and never rewrites existing rows. The PGRST204 self-heal in `sb.upsert` keeps old clients working before the migration runs.
- No AI calls run against the existing ~400 items in the closet — detection is opt-in for new uploads only.
